<p>Understanding proteins — like the spike protein of the coronavirus — is superimportant for the study of diseases and the development of drugs and vaccines. So there&#8217;s a lot of excitement about the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, built by the artificial intelligence lab DeepMind with the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Researchers there have used machine learning to predict and map more than 200 million protein structures from all kinds of organisms. Meghan McCarty-Carino of &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; spoke with Matthew Higgins, professor of molecular parasitology at the University of Oxford. He studies malaria parasites for a potential vaccine, and he said the database has sped up that work.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>In Rio de Janeiro, surgeons separated 3-year-old conjoined twins Arthur and Bernardo Lima in June. When the twins were born, they were attached at the head, their brains intertwined. Separating them would require dozens of complicated surgeries. To prepare, the twins&#8217; doctors in Rio used 3D printed models of the kids&#8217; brains and they practiced the surgeries in virtual reality, using goggles and controllers while connected to another medical team in London that had done this before. Marketplace&#8217;s Marielle Segarra speaks with Noor ul Owase Jeelani, a pediatric neurosurgeon at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital. His team led the VR training, and then he flew to Brazil to be one of the lead surgeons on the case.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week saw multiple major cryptocurrency hacks, one affecting wallets mostly linked to solana coins. Another hit Nomad, a blockchain bridge where users exchange assets on different blockchains. The losses totaled about $200 million. And these are just the latest hacks. So far this year, there&#8217;s been more than $1 billion stolen. So, why is this industry such a target?

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Dozens of people have died and hundreds have been sickened due to mistakes in the organ transplant system, according to a Senate investigation released this week. It  came after a review by the U.S. Digital Service found the network that matches patients and organs is gravely outdated. That program has been run for more than three decades by one nonprofit: the United Network for Organ Sharing, or UNOS. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Joseph Menn, who has been reporting on the problem for The Washington Post.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>House and Senate Democrats introduced a bill last week that aims to bring back net neutrality. The Barack Obama administration originally put the rules in place to prohibit internet providers from selectively favoring, blocking or slowing content on the internet. The Donald Trump administration rolled those rules back, arguing that the Federal Communications Commission didn&#8217;t have the power to enforce them. The new bill faces long odds, but if passed it would, once more, give the FCC oversight of internet service providers, or ISPs. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Ryan Singel, an open internet fellow at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society. He said the legislation does this by changing how internet service is categorized.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Climate and energy projects could see $370 billion in fresh funding thanks to a bill proposed by Senate Democrats. It&#8217;s called the Inflation Reduction Act, and it would also revise the tax code and reduce drug prices. In a surprise turn, it appears to have been developed with the support of Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, potentially paving the way for the bill to pass. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Jay Koh, managing director at the Lightsmith Group, a private-equity firm that invests in climate technology. He&#8217;s read the lengthy bill and says it would be a game changer for climate tech. It would inject four times more funding than the last big federal infusion in the 2009 stimulus bill.</p>

Those are cameras mounted on police vehicles or streetlights that scan license plates and feed that information into databases. But with more surveillance comes larger questions about who should be using this technology and for what purpose.

Now the nation&#8217;s scam artists are moving on from paper money to focus on money in ones and zeros: cryptocurrency. And for all the talk of cryptocurrencies being unhackable, the FBI is warning that ransomware from North Korea is a real threat to your digital wallet. Dina Temple-Raston, host of the &#8220;Click Here&#8221; podcast, shares how North Korea is trying to steal cryptocurrencies any way it can.</div>

Now the nation&#8217;s scam artists are moving on from paper money to focus on money in ones and zeros: cryptocurrency. And for all the talk of cryptocurrencies being unhackable, the FBI is warning that ransomware from North Korea is a real threat to your digital wallet. Dina Temple-Raston, host of the &#8220;Click Here&#8221; podcast, shares how North Korea is trying to steal cryptocurrencies any way it can.</div>

<p>Facebook is reallocating resources from its News tab product and its newsletter platform, Bulletin, to focus more on its creator economy, according to The Wall Street Journal. Its News products rely on paid content from professional journalists and publishers. That&#8217;s different from, say, news articles people sometimes see on their feed — not on the actual News tab — which are usually shared by friends.

Now it&#8217;s 988 — though the old one still works. Calls to the lifeline are routed to local counseling centers, generally in the caller&#8217;s community. Marketplace&#8217;s Marielle Segarra spoke with Tim Jansen, chief executive officer at Community Crisis Services in Maryland, one of the centers that answer 988 calls. He said Vibrant Emotional Health — the company that administers the lifeline — and the federal Department of Health and Human Services worked together to secure the number.

<p>Finland installed the world&#8217;s first functional sand battery this month. It heats up the sand, which can retain that heat for months at a time, according to the developers. This stored heat is energy that can be tapped later. All over the world, electric grid operators are looking to store more renewable energy from wind and solar and turning to big batteries, sometimes acres of them. Here in the U.S., more than 90% of this storage relies on lithium-ion batteries, according to the government, thanks to their efficiency and relatively low cost. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams spoke with Jason Burwen, vice president of energy storage for the American Clean Power Association, an industry group. She asked him what other kinds of battery innovations are getting him excited.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>All this week, we’ve been looking at the data and algorithms behind credit scores. While many lenders will use FICO scores, the company does have one major competitor, VantageScore. It was founded by the three credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax, and Transunion) in 2006. The company, which is independently managed, says its scoring model is more inclusive and predictive of credit risk than traditional models. &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; host Kimberly Adams recently spoke with Silvio Tavares, president and CEO of VantageScore, about what he and his team consider when they&#8217;re designing their algorithms. The following is an edited transcript of their conversation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Credit scores are these three digit snapshots — usually a number between 300 and 850 — that represent a borrower&#8217;s risk of default. They&#8217;re calculated by algorithms that use a borrower&#8217;s credit data, like the history of their credit payments, the amount of debt they owe, how long they&#8217;ve owned credit cards and more. Much of that data is collected and maintained by the three big credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. It&#8217;s a system that scores millions of Americans. But critics say the system doesn&#8217;t serve consumers who prioritize paying for things in cash or don&#8217;t have enough credit accounts. In this episode, &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; producer Daniel Shin explores how not having enough credit data to feed the algorithm can hurt a consumer&#8217;s chances of getting a loan or a mortgage.</p>

Much of that data is collected and maintained by the three big credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. It&#8217;s a system that scores millions of Americans. But critics say the system doesn&#8217;t serve consumers who prioritize paying for things in cash or don&#8217;t have enough credit accounts. In this episode, &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; producer Daniel Shin explores how not having enough credit data to feed the algorithm can hurt a consumer&#8217;s chances of getting a loan or a mortgage.</p>

Since the draft of the opinion was leaked in early May, businesses have had time to prepare for the formal ruling.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Supreme Court has now overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark case that guaranteed a constitutional right to have abortion. So now, states will determine whether people have those reproductive rights. About 26 states will likely ban or nearly ban abortion, given laws on the books or in the works. When the draft opinion of this Supreme Court decision was leaked in early May, we reported about the privacy concerns around some period-tracking apps and other online activity. Now that the official opinion is out, how will tech firms move forward in a post-Roe world? Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams posed that question to Rebecca Wexler, a law professor at University of California, Berkeley, and co-director of Berkeley Center for Law &amp; Technology. She says big and small tech companies will need to have a response to the future of users&#8217; data.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Sell-offs in the market for cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum continued this week. The rout followed another shock in May, when the value of terraUSD, a popular &#8220;stablecoin,&#8221; crashed. Stablecoins are supposed to have stable value tied to the U.S. dollar, which is why crypto traders use them to move money around this volatile market. But when terraUSD crashed, it wasn&#8217;t just traders who were hurt. Thousands of small investors were caught up in the meltdown, including people who put their money in Stablegains — a now-defunct crypto savings account company that promised returns of up to 15%. Marketplace&#8217;s Matt Levin recently spoke to some of those people. He told Meghan McCarty Carino they&#8217;re not the typical crypto investors you might think of and explained why they put their money into crypto in the first place.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Of the futuristic technology we see in movies and television, few have the appeal — and the sense of being tantalizingly close — as self-driving or autonomous vehicles. Today, we have cars and trucks with some autonomous or driver-assist features, but they aren&#8217;t quite the promise of the driverless cars we see in science fiction. The conversations about this mostly revolve around passenger cars navigating in cities, which still depend on a person who can take the wheel in case the computers crash and the technology fails. But perhaps we are a bit closer to that futuristic scenario when it comes to self-driving semitrucks. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Christopher Mims, a tech reporter at The Wall Street Journal. He recently wrote about the specialized technology behind autonomous big rigs.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The French carmaker Renault had a surprise success in the early 2000s, when a low-cost car it designed for developing countries, the Logan, was a hit with low-income people in France. That car is still a strong brand for Renault almost two decades later. And the company boasts that a new Logan costs as much as a used car from other manufacturers. Now, a former Renault designer is developing a new car, the Gazelle, that’s even more radical: an electric vehicle that’s not just low-cost to produce and purchase, but it&#8217;s also pretty easy to assemble. In the Bordeaux region of of France, John Laurenson took a ride in this low-tech car.</p>

<p>One of the big players in the push to update tech industry regulations is the Federal Trade Commission, whose job is to protect consumers and promote competition in the economy. It&#8217;s been just over a year since Lina Khan took over as chair of the agency and about a month since the confirmation of a third Democrat, Alvaro Bedoya, to the five-member commission, which broke a prolonged deadlock at the agency. That means Khan has a fresh chance to advance her agenda. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams recently spoke with Khan at her office and asked her about taking on Big Tech in the courts.</p>

It&#8217;s a resource aimed at giving people in abusive relationships better ability to control — or regain control of — their privacy and communications. Many criticized Apple after the rollout of its AirTag technology last year, warning it was being used to aid abusers in tracking and stalking their targets. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. She explains how Apple&#8217;s Safety Check works.</p>

<p>The Russian Association for Electronic Communications, a tech trade association, reported in March that as many as 70,000 tech workers had fled Russia since late February. The organization’s economists expect that number to more than double by summer. They&#8217;re headed to places like Turkey, Poland and other parts of Europe, as well as Central European countries like Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Some are even coming to the United States. But Russians who are fleeing may not be welcomed with open arms in other countries, even if they disagree with the war. Dina Temple-Raston, the host of the podcast &#8220;Click Here,&#8221; tells us the stories of two tech workers who got out of Russia.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg announced she will leave the company after 14 years in leadership. Sandberg joined Facebook, Meta&#8217;s parent, in the early years of the company, and she&#8217;s credited with helping to build it into the behemoth it is today by converting consumer data into ad revenue. So, what does her exit mean for Meta and its trajectory?

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Workers at game developer Activision Blizzard have voted to unionize. That&#8217;s the company behind games like Call of Duty, World of Warcraft and Candy Crush, and which has faced lawsuits and federal investigation for accusations of discrimination and sexual harassment. The new union, The Game Workers Alliance, comprises fewer than two dozen employees in one division of Raven Software, a subsidiary of Activision. But it&#8217;s the first union at a major company in the $180 billion gaming industry and could be a sign of things to come. Marketplace&#8217;s Marielle Segarra has the story.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Scientists are working toward building the next evolution of computers: quantum computers. And recently, a team of researchers in the Netherlands made another step toward that future after they successfully sent quantum data to three locations in a network. That development could lead to the creation of a quantum internet, an essential part of any future attempt to build quantum computing networks. Cade Metz, a technology correspondent for The New York Times, wrote about this recent development. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams spoke with Metz about quantum computing, what makes the concept different from the computers of today, and why this latest development with quantum networks involves &#8220;teleportation.&#8221;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>There’s at least one natural resource out there that’s completely finite on Earth: helium. And once we use it up, it’s gone for good. The lighter-than-air gas is in especially short supply right now, thanks to the closure of a major domestic processing facility and disruptions at a couple of plants overseas. That’s not just a problem for birthday balloons — a number of industries compete for the limited supply of helium: health care, manufacturing, the tech sector and scientific research. But those researchers are often at the back of the helium line.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Amid the grief in response to the mass shootings in Texas, New York and California, there&#8217;s an ongoing search for solutions, especially ones that can push through the political deadlock over gun control reform. One potential solution has to do with the data and technology used in background checks — specifically, in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Cassandra Crifasi, professor and deputy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions speaks with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about how that database only works well if the information going into it is accurate and timely.</p>

<p>Last week, the Department of Justice announced it would no longer prosecute hackers doing &#8220;good faith&#8221; cybersecurity research like testing or investigating a system to help correct a security flaw or vulnerability. It&#8217;s a change in how the DOJ enforces the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act following a ruling last year by the Supreme Court in Van Buren v. United States that limited the scope of the CFAA. Riana Pfefferkorn, a research scholar at the Stanford Internet Observatory, spoke with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about how this is part of an ongoing policy shift for the Justice Department over the last few years.</p>

That is when eggs are fertilized in a lab and then embryos are implanted in a patient, frozen for later use, donated or disposed of.

<p>Advances in medical technology have pushed the boundaries of fetal viability, a term for the point at which a fetus can survive outside the womb. When the Supreme Court handed down the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973, doctors could support babies delivered as early as about 28 weeks. Now, it&#8217;s 22 weeks. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Dr. Rachel Fleishman, who works in a neonatal intensive care unit at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. She wrote an essay for NBC about viability, and what it&#8217;s like caring for very premature infants.</p>

<p>This week, Congress held a public hearing on a topic that hasn&#8217;t been discussed openly in a congressional hearing in decades: unidentified flying objects. Yes, UFOs, or as the Pentagon is calling them, unidentified aerial phenomena, or UAPs. The hearing follows a report from the director of national intelligence released in June that said there were over 140 recorded sightings of UAPs that the military, like the name implies, could not identify. Chris Impey, a professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, has been following these developments. He explained the significance of the hearing and the report to Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old man accused of the racist rampage at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, Saturday followed a pattern becoming disturbing familiar for such attacks: online radicalization. The suspect allegedly wrote and posted a 180-page document before the mass shooting, citing various racist and anti-Semitic memes and conspiracy theories from websites such as 4chan. Federal officials are paying attention to this growing threat. President Joe Biden&#8217;s latest budget allocates $33 million for the FBI to investigate domestic terrorism. Jared Holt, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab, spoke with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about how the Justice Department has shifted efforts to address online extremism in the United States. He noted that it still has progress to make.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Last week, we got a stark reminder of the volatility of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin plummeted to its lowest value in 16 months. This time, the source of the cascade of selling came from an unexpected quarter. The market crashed after investors fled a type of crypto called stablecoins, whose worth is pegged to a traditional currency, like the U.S. dollar. Last week, that kinda fell apart. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Emily Nicolle, a crypto blogger for Bloomberg, about how stablecoins work.</p>

When it first came out, the iPod was a sleek alternative to bulky CD or cassette players. And the &#8220;touch circle&#8221; feature below the two-toned screen felt like a revolution. Over the years, the iPod got even smaller: no screen, just a clip and some buttons on the cute, little iPod Shuffle.

The group sued Clearview in 2020 for allegedly violating the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act. While the case deals with a state law, the settlement has national implications, including limiting who can access the company’s faceprint database. Clearview AI says that database contains some 20 billion facial images. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Calli Schroeder, global privacy counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, who said the suit focused on the use of biometric markers, including faces.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Using passwords as a way to prove your identity online, though ubiquitous, has several downsides. People forget them and, if they aren&#8217;t strong enough, passwords can be guessed by criminals. Last week, Apple, Google and Microsoft announced plans to work together on a “passwordless” authentication system for their various browsers, services and devices. The cross-platform collaboration is expected to start rolling out over the next year. The companies say they will support Fast Identity Online (FIDO) protocols across their most commonly used products.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>As supporters and opponents of abortion rights continue to parse the leaked draft ruling obtained by Politico this week, one of the many questions that have come up is what the overturning of Roe v. Wade, and stricter anti-abortion laws, would mean for our lives online. Technology plays a major role in connecting people with reproductive health services, but if those now-legal options become illegal in a post-Roe environment, will those online interactions remain private?

<p>Social media companies say they are working hard to prevent hate speech from being posted on their platforms, and remove it when it is. But that&#8217;s an ongoing challenge as they operate in numerous countries with many languages and social contexts. A new report from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate reveals anti-Muslim hate speech and misinformation still proliferate online. Imran Ahmed is the founder and CEO of the group. He spoke with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about the CCDH&#8217;s latest research and why social media platforms are still struggling to moderate this kind of content.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A major part of Russia&#8217;s war strategy is the control of messages spread online, both in occupied areas of Ukraine and within Russia itself. Platforms like Facebook have been banned and labeled &#8220;extremist&#8221; by Russian authorities. Some sites, like YouTube, remain partially available. At the same time, the Kremlin is trying to push Russian users to a domestic video platform, &#8220;RuTube.&#8221; It&#8217;s part of a strategy to convince citizens and content creators to abandon Western social media sites.

At the end of the day, a good, innovative video game needs one important element. According to industry veteran Reggie Fils-Aimé, former President of Nintendo America, it&#8217;s simply to make the game good and fun.

<p>The European Union is pushing to regulate big, global technology firms. In their latest move, EU negotiators agreed to a broad set of legislation called the Digital Services Act, which aims to, among a long list of other items, require social media companies to make their algorithms more transparent and limit the spread of disinformation on their platforms. While the language in the DSA still needs to be finalized, it seems clear that platforms like Twitter — regardless of who owns it — will need to adapt to those rules. Eric Heinze is a professor of law and humanities at Queen Mary University of London. He spoke with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about how strict these EU rules will be and what they mean for Elon Musk&#8217;s vision for Twitter.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Twitter users and investors have been trying to guess what&#8217;s ahead for the social media platform since the company agreed to a $44 billion buyout from Tesla and SpaceX CEO — and Twitter superuser — Elon Musk. Musk has praised Twitter as an important platform for public discourse and says he plans to make it better by cracking down on bot accounts, increasing transparency around its algorithms and making it a more free speech-friendly space. But what happens when that free speech happens to be false speech? Emily Dreyfuss, a journalist and senior editor at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, spoke to Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams about how the change of ownership, which is subject to regulatory approval, could affect Twitter&#8217;s attempts to crack down on misinformation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to what you might have seen in the Rock’s movie “San Andreas,” we still can’t predict earthquakes. But there have been recent advances in seismology assisted by artificial intelligence. Researchers at Stanford used a deep-learning algorithm to detect more earthquakes in cities by filtering out the normal noise and vibrations of urban life. And a group at Penn State used machine learning to analyze simulated fault movements in the lab and look for indicators that could help predict an impending quake. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Egill Hauksson, a research professor of geophysics at Caltech, who said these tools can give us a fuller understanding of earthquake patterns.</p>

<p>Twitter officially accepted a buyout offer from Elon Musk on Monday valued at $44 billion. Musk is the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, the richest person in the world and has been described as something of a memelord on Twitter. He&#8217;s praised the platform as a bastion of free speech but he has some ideas to make it &#8230; more free: more transparency about the algorithm, maybe an edit button and less content moderation. What he&#8217;s not after, he&#8217;s said, is making money. Then he&#8217;s in the right place, says Amy Webb, a futurist and founder of the Future Today Institute.</p>

More and more companies are rolling back degree requirements that were part of many job descriptions. Today, we&#8217;ll hear how that dynamic has given new opportunities to people like Stanley Omotuyole, who left Nigeria a couple of years ago, giving up a degree program in laboratory science to join his dad in Seattle.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Keeping tabs on groundwater is more important than ever. Most of the western United States is suffering the most extreme drought in 12 centuries, and climate change only promises to make things worse. Underground aquifers can provide lifelines for farmers and cities, but pumping them dry causes the earth to sag, which is called subsidence. This can create sinkholes and destroy infrastructure. But groundwater is hard to monitor; it&#8217;s sometimes located thousands of feet below the surface. That&#8217;s where satellites come in. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Kyra Kim, a postdoctoral fellow at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, where they&#8217;ve created a model to track groundwater levels using two satellite systems.</p>

<p>Accessing mental health care has long been difficult  and the pandemic has further increased the strain. And there are thousands of mental health apps — about 20,000 and counting — designed to tackle the problem. They range from mood trackers, guided mindfulness exercises and apps with chatbots that teach coping skills. Spending on them has grown quickly since 2019 and is predicted to reach about $500 million this year, according to a report from Deloitte. But not all these apps are backed by science. Stephen Schueller is a professor at UC Irvine and the executive director of One Mind PsyberGuide, which provides expert ratings for hundreds of wellness apps. He talked to host Meghan McCarty Carino about how the apps are rated.</p>

<p>Netflix will give investors a glimpse of its growth Tuesday with the release of its quarterly earnings report. It’s been hard to sustain the pace of 2020, when the world was stuck at home on the couch. But now the company is chasing a new market: video games. And it&#8217;s a big one. Mobile gaming generated an estimated $90 billion in 2021. Over the last year, Netflix has bought up small, independent gaming studios— it acquired a third one last month. The company now offers multiple titles free to subscribers, including a card game, bowling, an upcoming first-person shooter and two based on its popular show &#8220;Stranger Things.&#8221; Leveraging a company&#8217;s intellectual property for games is nothing new, but how well can Netflix play this game? Michael Pachter is a research analyst with Wedbush Securities. He told &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8217;s&#8221; Meghan McCarty Carino that Netflix&#8217;s catalog of hit shows might not lend itself to this strategy.</p>

<p>Google and Apple have been slow to relinquish the hefty commissions they charge on app payments. Developers have been pushing for alternatives to the payment systems run by those tech giants, hoping they could save some money. In South Korea, Google is now required to let app makers use alternative payment systems, but the tech company will still take almost the same commission. For instance, in cases in which Google takes 30% of revenue, it will charge developers that use other systems 26%. Here in the U.S., Spotify recently reached an agreement with Google to charge subscribers through a non-Google system a smaller fee than usual, but there&#8217;s no word yet on how much smaller. So will these changes actually spur competition, as intended? Meghan McCarty Carino of &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; put that question to Eric Seufert, an independent analyst with the website Mobile Dev Memo. He said such small tweaks might not be worth very much.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The metaverse is coming — so we&#8217;re told — though it&#8217;s hard to know exactly what that means. There are companies using virtual reality to recreate office life down to the conference rooms, for some reason. And, of course, VR is big for gaming and other diversions. But VR is also increasingly being used in health care, especially as more services go remote. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Brennan Spiegel, the director of health services research at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He said about 200 hospitals in the U.S. are using virtual reality tools to not only help train doctors, but also to help manage patients&#8217; pain from surgery, irritable bowel syndrome or cancer. And recently, this technology&#8217;s applications have expanded from treating patients to diagnosing conditions like glaucoma.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The pandemic sent grocery shoppers online like never before, and federal food assistance programs are trying to keep up. The main food stamp program, known as SNAP, rolled out online shopping pre-pandemic, and it&#8217;s now available in almost every state. That hasn&#8217;t been the case for WIC, a similar program that gives credit to moms and kids for healthy foods, like milk, fruits and vegetables. The USDA started a pilot program late last year for WIC online shopping in a handful of states. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Brian Dittmeier, senior director of public policy at the National WIC Association, which provides education and advocacy. He said it will be years before the program expands nationwide, but it&#8217;s important that it does.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s going to be a minute before the contours of an actual collective bargaining agreement come into focus for workers at the Amazon fulfillment center in Staten Island, New York, who voted to unionize Friday. Amazon says it&#8217;s evaluating options to contest the election. But the union drive has put workplace conditions in the spotlight, including how the company uses technology to monitor its warehouse employees. Lisa Kresge, a researcher at the UC Berkeley Labor Center, said there&#8217;s a long history of unions negotiating management&#8217;s use of tech in the workplace, and Amazon warehouses use plenty of it.</p>

That includes everything from defunct satellites to the debris caused from explosions in space. The president wants the Office of Space Commerce to ramp up its ability to track this stuff in real time. Marketplace&#8217;s Meghan McCarty Carino speaks with Moriba Jah, chief scientist and co-founder of the space debris tracking company Privateer. Jah says scientists are currently tracking about 50,000 pieces of space debris, down to the size of a cellphone, and that there&#8217;s much, much more out there.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>President Joe Biden is pushing for more green energy storage to get us out of the gasoline crisis. He&#8217;s encouraging the American special minerals industry to increase production. Biden wants more lithium, nickel, cobalt and other metals to come from  the U.S. to fuel more domestic manufacturing of batteries that power electric vehicles. More electric vehicles mean less demand for gas, which means less reliance on oil from other countries, particularly important when gas prices are high, like they are now. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Leah Stokes, who teaches energy and environmental politics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. She explained the old-school law Biden is turning to to address this modern problem.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Steve Wilhite, inventor of the graphics interchange format, also known as GIF, died this month at the age of 74. Animated or not, GIFs may now be a common, free feature of the internet, but the tech that powered Wilhite&#8217;s format was patented by the technology company Unisys. For a few contentious years during the internet&#8217;s youthful era, Unisys wanted to charge fees for all the sparkly GIFs we were sharing. This fight — over who controls how information moves around the web and who gets paid in the process — continues to this day. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams spoke with Jason Eppink, an artist and a former curator at the Museum of the Moving Image, who gave her a GIF history lesson.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>European Union lawmakers recently unveiled the Digital Markets Act, which aims to limit the power of &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; — companies so big and popular that they shape entire industries — like the tech companies behind messaging apps. One rule would require that apps be “interoperable” with one another, so a startup, for instance, could let its users send messages to people using Apple&#8217;s iMessage or Meta&#8217;s WhatsApp seamlessly. Companies that don’t comply would face steep penalties — up to 20% of their global revenue. Alex Heath covers tech and internet platforms at The Verge. He laid out some of the pros and cons of the proposal.</p>

Marketplace&#8217;s Andy Uhler previously reported on how crypto miners were drawn to the small Texas town of Rockdale because of its robust electric power infrastructure that hasn&#8217;t seen much use in recent years.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Video game developers, programmers and artists are gathering in San Francisco this week for the first in-person Game Developers Conference since 2019. One topic getting a lot of attention is non-fungible tokens — digital certificates showing ownership of digital assets like a picture or video. It’s a topic for Quality Assurance, where we take a closer look at a big tech story. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Stephen Totilo, who covers gaming for Axios and is attending the conference.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>This week, President Biden warned businesses to be wary of potential cyberattacks from Russia, recommending companies increase their cybersecurity defenses. That means more work and higher stakes for the technicians maintaining those defenses. There are hundreds of thousands of vacancies in the cybersecurity sector right now, meaning those already working often end up taking on more duties, burning out and leaving the field. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Lesley Carhart, an incident responder for the industrial cybersecurity company Dragos. <em><strong>Warning: This interview touches on substance use disorder and suicide.</strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Internet access has been crucial during the pandemic, allowing some of us to work remotely or order all manner of things for delivery. But there&#8217;s not much research so far on the connection between internet access and health. A new paper in the Journal of the American Medical Association looks at how COVID mortality rates varied based on factors like race, socioeconomic status — and internet access. Researchers found that counties with less access could expect more COVID deaths; for every extra percentage point of homes without internet, another 2 to 6 people per 100,000 would die. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Qinyun Lin, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Chicago’s Center for Spatial Data Science, who was the paper&#8217;s lead author.</p>

Up until last summer, China led the world in crypto mining — thanks in part to its hydroelectric infrastructure.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>How your information shows up on a credit report can affect your ability to rent a home, get a mortgage or take out a loan. So you want to make sure that information is accurate, especially after a name change. But that can be a particular challenge for transgender and nonbinary people who change their name to better align it with their identity. Last month, the Consumer Data Industry Association issued recommendations for how those consumers can update their credit reports, but a group of 145 organizations says the industry needs to do more. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Spencer Watson, president of the Center for LGBTQ Economic Advancement and Research, which was one of those groups.</p>

<p>Last week, Tinder rolled out a new feature that will allow users to pay $2.50 to check if matches have certain types of criminal records associated with a sex offender registry, arrests or convictions for “violent or harmful behavior.&#8221; The company partnered with public record aggregator Garbo to help users make more informed choices about who they interact with online. But some experts are concerned that use of this specific data may not be the best way to improve user safety. Sarah Lageson, an associate professor at Rutgers University-Newark School of Criminal Justice shared her concerns with Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams.</p>

<p><em>Today, we&#8217;re re-airing an episode from Jan. 20.</em></p>
<p>Mobile carriers are shutting down their 3G networks to open up more bandwidth for expanded 5G networks. On Feb. 22, AT&amp;T will be the first carrier to end its 3G services. T-Mobile will shut down its network by July 1 and Verizon by the end of the year. Commercial 3G networks first started popping up in the early 2000s and were about 30 times faster than their 2G predecessors, opening the door for new technology — remember Palm Pilots and BlackBerrys? — and creating infrastructure for many of the apps we use today. Joanna Stern, who&#8217;s covered the coming shutdown for The Wall Street Journal, joins us to discuss.</p>

Commercial 3G networks first started popping up in the early 2000s and were about 30 times faster than their 2G predecessors, opening the door for new technology — remember Palm Pilots and BlackBerrys? — and creating infrastructure for many of the apps we use today. Joanna Stern, who&#8217;s covered the coming shutdown for The Wall Street Journal, joins us to discuss.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The IRS announced on Monday it&#8217;s dropping a plan to require taxpayers to sign up for and use facial recognition software. The plan had been to require people to use a service provided by a third-party company, ID.me, to verify their identities to access documents or make payments online.

    <itunes:summary><![CDATA[<p>The IRS announced on Monday it&#8217;s dropping a plan to require taxpayers to sign up for and use facial recognition software. The plan had been to require people to use a service provided by a third-party company, ID.me, to verify their identities to access documents or make payments online. It was already being rolled out for people who created new online accounts this year, and was going to kick in for existing accounts by this summer.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, are basically digital certificates of ownership, a virtual claim that an image or gif or even a song belongs to you. And while some artists are happy to jump into this new space, others have been surprised — or furious — to find that strangers beat them to owning and selling NFTs of their work. Just last week, several musical artists publicly complained after the website HitPiece temporarily listed NFTs for their songs or albums without the artists&#8217; permission. But does selling someone else&#8217;s art as an NFT break the law? Aram Sinnreich is a professor and chair of the communication studies division at American University. He said this gets into a gray area, at least when it comes to existing copyright law.</p>

<p>On Friday, the National Labor Relations Board starts sending unionization ballots to more than 6,000 workers at an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama. Organizers say they want a union so they can negotiate safer working conditions and dispute terminations. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Marketplace senior reporter Meghan McCarty Carino, who covers workplace culture. She said it&#8217;s significant that these workers are getting a redo after their union vote last year, which failed.</p>

But for now, they are continuing their push into the mainstream. NFTs are digital assets, like JPEGs or tweets, that can be bought and sold on a marketplace. They&#8217;re a way to make something that traditionally could just be copied and shared online, rare — and therefore, to some, valuable. And as transaction prices for these items climbs, so does the risk of scams.

Nevertheless, housing advocates say landlords have filed for hundreds of thousands of evictions since March of 2020. And many of those tenants can’t afford a lawyer to advise or defend them.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>The latest effort to reign in Big Tech cleared a procedural step in the Senate last week, moving one step closer to a floor vote. The American Innovation and Choice Online Act would prevent big tech firms from giving preference to their own products and services. According to some lawmakers, that unfairly stifles competition. Though the bill has bipartisan support, bipartisan concern over the details means it&#8217;s getting hit with requests for changes on questions like privacy and who exactly it applies to. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Will Rinehart, a senior research fellow at the Center for Growth and Opportunity, about the bill&#8217;s significance.</p>

<p>Even before the pandemic, the economy was seeing a shift to automation as companies looked for cheaper, more efficient ways to build their products or serve more customers. Now, the pandemic has led to staffing shortages in multiple industries and has accelerated the trend, which means in the future you may be more likely to order your food with a QR code, interact with a chatbot instead of a person for customer service or use a self-operating kiosk at a business that may never go back to the old way of doing things. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Kristen Broady, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, about how the pandemic is speeding up this shift. For many businesses, it&#8217;s an economic decision, Broady says.</p>

AT&amp;T plans to discontinue its 3G network by February 22, T-Mobile by July 1st, and Verizon by the end of the year. Commercial 3G networks first started popping up in the early 2000s and were about 30 times faster than their 2G predecessors.

		<description><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft announced plans this week to buy game developer and publisher Activision Blizzard, known for games like World of Warcraft and Overwatch, for an all-cash deal worth almost $69 billion. Both companies are big players in the gaming market — Microsoft makes the Xbox — meaning the massive deal is likely to attract scrutiny from antitrust regulators, even as Activision Blizzard continues to face allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Dina Bass, Seattle bureau chief and technology reporter for Bloomberg News, to get a sense of Microsoft’s strategy.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon are set to turn on their newest 5G technology Wednesday. Both companies purchased rights to more of the spectrum last year and have been ready to deploy it for months. But those plans have been on hold over concerns the expansion into that bandwidth could interfere with the tech on planes, specifically an aircraft&#8217;s altimeter, one of the tools that help planes land safely. To mitigate those concerns, the Federal Aviation Administration released a list of 50 airports that will have 5G buffer zones. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Joe Kane, director of broadband and spectrum policy at the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[<p>A U.S. District Court handed Lina Khan, the head of the Federal Trade Commission, a win this week. The judge gave the go-ahead for the FTC to continue its antitrust suit against Meta, the parent company of Facebook, alleging that the company pursued an illegal “buy-or-bury scheme” to root out competitors. The court shot down the agency’s initial complaint in June, after the judge said the FTC failed to sufficiently define the social media market and the company&#8217;s share of it. Marketplace&#8217;s Kimberly Adams speaks with Matt Stoller, director of research at the American Economic Liberties Project.</p>
